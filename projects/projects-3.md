Study Hall is a web application with the motto of "made by students, for students." We set out to create a site that allowed those who were willing to host a tutoring session for a specific class to help out students at a chosen time. It allows anyone to create a tutoring session at a chosen time, date, and place for students to attend and receive help. The site also allows for many different courses to help any student from any different major.

For this project, I helped create the tutor session pages and collections, specifically the manage and create session pages. On these pages, anyone can create a tutoring session for students to attend, as well as edit information about a session they've created. The tutor sessions collections was also made so that tutors could create a tutoring session and add it to the database, where another group member could subscribe to that collection and filter the sessions into specific departments and classes.

After working on this project, I learned to value communication a lot more, since many of the pages we worked on linked together via collections. If we didn't communicate, it would be incredibly hard to have different pages use the correct collections/fields so that everything in the site is connected. It was also a bit hard to coordinate since we have different schedules to accomdate for. Overall, communication was the most important aspect I learned about through this project.
