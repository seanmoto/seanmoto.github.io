This idea is by Sean Motogawa and Justin Pham.

## Overview

The Problem: UH students often waste too much time walking down with a full basket of laundry just to find all the washing machines are in use.

The Solution: Wash & Dash is a web application that allows students to update the status of washing machines in use. This way, students won't have to walk down and be disappointed when all the washing machines are already in use.

## Mockup Page Ideas

- Landing Page
- User Page
- Admin Page
- Washing Maching Usage Page for each dorm

## Use Case ideas

- New user goes to landing page, signs up, gets user page, sets up profile (choosing dorm).
- Admin goes to landing page, logins in, gets admin page, can control on site if washing machine is in use.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, goes to washing machine usage page, changes machine state to 'in use.'

## Beyond the basics
- Login using UH CAS to guarantee that all users are UH students.
- Text message notifications. Tells user when washing machine is done.
- User rating system (for if the user is truthfully using the washing machines) to mark other users accuracy of using washing machines.
