## It's basically the same thing

Going into using Semantic UI, I felt it was silly to bother learning this framework to use with CSS and HTML. Why bother learning it, when I could just use what I knew about CSS and HTML instead of committing time to learning Semantic UI. The reason is simple: Semantic UI’s simplicity. Raw CSS can be a painful task as you the user must set everything for any element on your page.  It’s much easier to get the basics of a site down by using the simple elements Semantic UI provides, such as menus, grids, containers, and other elements, easily accessed by typing a simple “ui menu” with other attributes like “big” or “centered.” 

## Being simple isn't bad

At the same time, I find it difficult to stylize certain elements when nested within a semantic element and HTML, which led me to frustratingly failing to edit the stylesheet correctly and using the style attribute within my HTML code.  I don’t have a lot of experience with designing web pages, but Semantic UI definitely makes it easier to start from scratch and create a layout with menus, grids, and containers. Semantic UI allows me to choose base elements and alter elements without having to design from scratch.

## Similar appearance, different purpose

Despite how complicated learning Semantic UI on top of CSS and HTML can be, Semantic UI is a huge boon for anyone looking to create a webpage. I found Semantic UI great and simple way to create a website, while using certain attributes to change Semantic UI elements to fit my needs. If that wasn’t enough, the raw CSS and HTML can still be used with Semantic UI if I wanted more control of the elements on my webpage. Semantic UI is worth learning alongside CSS and HTML due to the flexibility of using already created and modifiable elements together with raw and completely customizable CSS and HTML.
