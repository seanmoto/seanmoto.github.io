## The var-iety of languages and Javascript

Javascript was always a language I thought to be very similar to Java but less strict with its syntax. I had a short experience with Javascript in a previous web development course, but I never knew about ES6 or any specific style guide, like using “let” and “const” for variables. I previously only used "var" for everything, so the introduction of "let" and "const" adds a little variety to the way I code in Javascript. Though from what I’ve learned about Javascript so far, I would say that it still seems almost exactly like Java.

## One of many

For software engineering, maybe it’s because I’ve only coded in Java and C/C++ before, but I find Javascript to seem very similar to those languages, and I would consider it a fine programming language for software engineering without much experiences with other different languages like Lisp or Python. Although I lack experience with different programming languages, I would say that different types of languages can all be considered good programming languages, since they could teach different lessons with their differing syntax. Javascript is another language I'll need to learn along with many others.

## Stress us to test us

The workouts of the day are a concept I’ll appreciate as we head further into the semester. I believe it’s important for us as developers to have a lot of our knowledge at the ready without having to look online for every little piece of information. There is a time limit and places stress on students, which I really enjoy about the WODs. We will have our deadlines and our future environment may stress us out, but we have to prepare for those moments, which I believe the WODs will help us with. We may stumble and fall short, but the more we struggle and feel stressed, the more we will grow under the stress and become better.
