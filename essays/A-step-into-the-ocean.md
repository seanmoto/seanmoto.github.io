## What I thought I didn't have

I’ve always been impressed with people creating their own programs, whether it's video games, tools, or even websites. I never believed that I could create programs for the longest time, since I believed I didn’t have enough creativity to create anything. I believed I didn't have that creative spark to create something from my imagination. But when I found myself programming for the first time, I thought that “this wasn’t so bad. Coding is actually kind of fun,” and that I could maybe create something if I tried. 

## A step into the vast ocean

Stepping into the world of computer science, I’d love to learn as much as I can about software engineering and the process of creating a program. From the outside, I feel like there’s so much to learn to create one program, from learning the many languages and syntax to the implementation of multithreading, artificial intelligence, and smart design. I want to learn as much as I can to create a game or a useful program, and I’ll need to start taking in as much knowledge as I can to understand the many concepts in this vast landscape of computer science.

## Learn now for the future

From here on, I hope to continue to involve myself with programming projects that will further develop my skills. I’ve only recently helped out with development for a fan-made version of an old game, but I’d like to be able to make my own game with my vision. I’ve had a few attempts at trying to make something on my own, but it’s incredibly challenging to continue to motivate yourself everyday to do a project, especially when you are unsure of how to proceed. I aspire to learn more about programming, so I can return to those forgotten projects in the future and create something I’d enjoy.
